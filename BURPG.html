							<h2>Year 1 (Ongoing)</h2>
								<p>During my first year at BURPG I took part in the team's high-powered rocket competition, the goal of which was to design and build a rocket that would reach an altitude as close to
									4000 feet as possible. On board the rocket must be an altimeter that we design and build ourselves, and its readings must be as close to a store-bought altimeter as possible. Additionally,
									the rocket must record some sort of data, which the onboard computer (which we also design and build ourselves) interprets into a real-life application.</p>
								<p>The rocket I helped design was called Project Platypus because it detected Earth's magnetic field and measured the growth rate of bacteria at high altitudes and G-forces, and apparently
									platypi use the Earth's magnetic field to hunt and thus to grow. Our rocket used a magnetometer to measure the magnitude of Earth's magnetic field, which our onboard computer system
									(modeled after an Arduino but printed on our own PCB) polled and stored the data from at regular time intervals. The board then used the Chapman-Ferraro equation to calculate the altitude of
									Earth's magnetopause during a significantly powerful coronal mass ejection, thus giving us a rough estimate for a safe altitude for astronauts before deleterious health effects from solar
									radiation start to become an issue. The altimeter we designed also was polled at the same time intervals, so we were able to establish a relationship between altitude and the strength of Earth's magnetic
									field.</p>
								<p>On board the rocket was also a makeshift cuvette containing common arthrobacter. The cuvette was placed inside a dark 3D printed box, inside of which were violet LEDs on one side and a photoresistor on the other.
									Over the course of the flight, the bacteria reproduced, thus decreasing the amount of light that reached the photoresistor, which the onboard computer system measured. Another identical setup was on the ground
									as a control. Thus, by comparing the change in voltage measured by the onboard computer system to the change in voltage detected on the ground, we could determine whether high altitudes and G-forces affect
									the growth rate of bacteria.</p>
								<p>Project Platypus is expected to be completed by April 2018, and the circuitry and software (affectionately called <i>The Billboard</i>) are projected to be completed by February 2018.</p>
								<p>As of December 4, 2017, our team is in the critical design review stage.</p>
